# alfred_zotquery
A (failed attempt to update an ) Alfred workflow to interact with a user's Zotero data.

See the heroic and elegant Alfred / Zotero workflow at https://github.com/deanishe/zothero


Originally created by fractaledmind - after it fell behind updates to Zotero (to v.5) and ALfred (to v.3), my attempt to update it produced the 
following unholy hybrid. The updated zotquery script is here in the top level - it should be used in place of the previous version.
Almost all changes were made to deal with changes to Zotero's underlying SQL database. THe updated workflow also deals with 
the changes made to paths used by Alfred 3.
